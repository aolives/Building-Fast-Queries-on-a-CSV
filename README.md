# Building Fast Queries on a CSV

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aolives/Building-Fast-Queries-on-a-CSV/HEAD)

In this project, we'll create a class that represents our inventory. The methods in that class will implement the queries that we want to answer about our inventory. We will also preprocess that data to make those queries run faster.

Here are some queries that we will want to answer:

- Given a laptop id, find the corresponding data.
- Given an amount of money, find whether there are two laptops whose total price is that given amount.
- Identify all laptops whose price falls within a given budget.

More than anything else this project exists to show you that I am familiar with:

- Data Concepts
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
